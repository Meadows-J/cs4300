For the setup I added the cs4300 github respositoty with an ssh key and cloned the repository. After that I added the homework 1 and homework 2 folders and added all the python files for homework 1.

Explinations and how to run
Task1:
in the ~/cs4300/homework1/src$ file run the command python3 task1.py the output should be Hellow World!
The code is just a simple print statment that prints the requiered test.

Task2:
in the ~/cs4300/homework1/src$ file run the command python3 task2.py the output should show the math opperation of a float and int and showing how the types interact. The next line should show a string and the reversed version of a string. The last output section shows how True and False interact in an and or an or statment.

Task3:
in the ~/cs4300/homework1/src$ file run the command python3 task3.py the output should show first the three possible values for the is a number positive or negitive. The second section should show the list of the first 10 prime numbers. The final should show the sum from 0 to 100.

Task4:
in the ~/cs4300/homework1/src$ file run the command python3 task4.py the output should show first the discounted price of two ints, then 1 int and 1 float, and finally two floats.

Task5:
in the ~/cs4300/homework1/src$ file run the command python3 task5.py the output should show first the first three books data out of five. Second it should print 4 students data using a dictionary.

Task6:
in the ~/cs4300/homework1/src$ file run the command python3 task6.py the output should show the word count of the file.

Task7:
in the ~/cs4300/homework1/src$ file run the command python3 task6.py the output should show the two np arrays and then show np add and subrtacting to show basic numpy opperations.

Tests
To run the test run the command pytest tests/ from the homework1 file. It should show 26 test passed
